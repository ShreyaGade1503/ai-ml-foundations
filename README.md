# AI/ML Foundations

Hi, I’m Shreya  
I’m a diploma student working in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

This repository is created to strengthen my core foundations in:
- Python for data analysis
- NumPy and Pandas
- Data visualization using Matplotlib
- Basic machine learning concepts

## Purpose of This Repository
The goal of this repository is to build a strong and clear understanding of AI/ML fundamentals that will support real-world projects and advanced applications in the future.

Here, I will:
- Practice core concepts with hands-on notebooks
- Work with datasets to understand data cleaning and analysis
- Document my learning in a structured and consistent way

## Long-Term Goal
To develop practical, end-to-end machine learning projects and build a professional portfolio that reflects my skills and growth in AI/ML.
